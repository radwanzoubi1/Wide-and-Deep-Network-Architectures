# Wide-and-Deep-Network-Architectures
This project uses the Autism Screening Data for Toddlers to implement and evaluate wide and deep networks for predicting autism risk. Tasks include data preprocessing, feature engineering with cross-product embeddings, hyperparameter tuning, and comparing architectures. Results are visualized in a reproducible Jupyter notebook.
